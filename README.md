# django-app-praktikum
This is an app for students or just anyone who wants to keep track of their current internship/job applications. 

We know applying for a job/internship can be a tough process, that's why we are here to help. We are a group of Mexicans studying in Germany 
and we are currently applying for several internships and we know sometimes is hard to keep track of them ... 
This is when this app comes in helpful. 

To install this application, we recommend to follow the instructions in the official documentation files from Django:
   https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/intro/install/

Please make sure to have Python 3.x.y or higher. 

Once done that, open your terminal and write the following command lines: 


$ python -m pip install Django 


or for Windows: 


$ py -m pip install Django


Once completed, done! You're all set and ready to run the application. Open your prefered code editor (VS Code is the one I used since it has an integrated terminal)

Then cd to the root of the project "/mysite" and from there run the following command lines: 


$  python ./migrate.py makemigrations


$  python ./migrate.py migrate 


$  python ./migrate.py runserver


Once up and running open your browser and go to your http://localhost:8000/

register with a valid and strong enough password and you'll be ready to try the app.
